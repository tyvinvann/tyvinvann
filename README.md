- 👋 Hi, I’m @tyvinvann
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about software development and advancing my skills in coding and computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and once mastered, eventually plan on learning other scripting languages to enhance my ability through the front end and back end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner level projects that demonstrate my learning experience in software development, hopefully to lead me into a career towards software engineering or full-stack development.
- 📫 How to reach me... LinkedIn: /in/tyvinvann
